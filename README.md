# SnapIt

> Content is too scattered on the Internet. Every day we find compelling content on numerous websites and blogs. Unfortunately there is no way to save the content so that it can be viewed later.

> That is why we created SnapIt.

## Usage

SnapIt is a web application that also utilizes a Chrome extension. To use SnapIt users will need to start the web application, create an account and then start snapping their favorite items using the Chrome extension.

### Website

The website runs on a Node.js server on the backend. On the front end it uses AngularJs and Twitter bootstrap for a responsive design. Here is what the website home page looks like.
